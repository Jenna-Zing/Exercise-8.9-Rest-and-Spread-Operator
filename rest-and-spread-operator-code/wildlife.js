/*
 * Observations:
 * 1. The `lionProfile` object is shallow-copied using the spread operator (`...`).
     This creates a **new object with a new reference** in memory. In other words, `lionGeneticProfile !== lionProfile`.

  2. The spread operator copies **all top-level properties** of `lionProfile` into the new object.
     - If a property is a **primitive value** (like a string or number), it is **copied by value** â€” a true, independent copy.
     - If a property is a **reference type** (like an object or array), only the **reference is copied** â€” the original and copy both point to the **same nested data in memory**.

  3. In this specific example, all properties in `lionProfile` are primitive types (`name`, `age`, `species`),
     so the shallow copy behaves just like a deep copy â€” no shared references exist between `lionProfile` and `lionGeneticProfile`.

  4. A new top-level property, `genetics`, is added to `lionGeneticProfile`. This does **not** affect `lionProfile`,
     because we're modifying a property that exists only on the shallow copy, not shared data.

  5. Warning: If `lionProfile` had nested objects (e.g., `traits: { strength: 90 }`), then changes to those nested properties
     on `lionGeneticProfile` would **also appear in `lionProfile`**, because they would both reference the same nested object.

  ðŸ’¡ Conclusion:
     - The spread operator (`...`) creates a **shallow copy**: it copies top-level properties into a new object.
     - Primitive values are **copied by value**, while objects and arrays are **copied by reference**.
     - For deep copies (full duplication of all levels), you need a different approach.

	  TLDR:  In this Task #4, the spread operator creates a shallow copy of the object and we added another property in the copied object 
	  (and it did not affect the original).  This means that top-level properties are duplicated and assigned new memory space (if they 
	  are primitives; However, if they're non-primitives like an array or object, then it's only shallowly-copied and since they share 
	  the same reference, we'd see modifications in both the original and "copy").

);
console.log(
  "originalEcosystemHealth food supply === updatedEcosystemHealth food supply -> ",
  ecosystemHealth.foodSupply === updatedEcosystemHealth.foodSupply
);
/*
 * Observations:
 * 1. In this example, we perform a shallow copy of the `ecosystemHealth` object using the spread operator in an object literal.
 *    This creates a new top-level object where `updatedEcosystemHealth !== ecosystemHealth`.
 *
 * 2. However, instead of copying the `foodSupply` property directly (which is a nested object),
 *    we also explicitly create a **new shallow copy** of `foodSupply` using:
 *    `foodSupply: { ...ecosystemHealth.foodSupply, carnivores: "Extremely Low" }`
 *
 *    This ensures that:
 *    - `updatedEcosystemHealth.foodSupply !== ecosystemHealth.foodSupply` (they point to different objects),
 *    - and updating `carnivores` does not affect the original `ecosystemHealth` object.
 *
 * 3. This avoids a common shallow copy pitfall:
 *    If we had done this instead:
 *
 *    ```
 *    const badCopy = { ...ecosystemHealth };
 *    badCopy.foodSupply.carnivores = "Critically Endangered";
 *    console.log(ecosystemHealth.foodSupply.carnivores); // Modified!
 *    ```
 *
 *    ...we would have accidentally mutated the original, because the nested `foodSupply` object is copied **by reference** in a shallow copy.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Conclusion:
 * - The spread operator only performs a **shallow copy**.
 * - If an object contains nested structures (objects, arrays), you must explicitly copy those as well if you want full separation.
 * - This pattern (`...outerObj, nestedKey: { ...outerObj.nestedKey, changes }`) is a safe way to update nested data **immutably**
 *   (immutably means you donâ€™t change the original object/array â€” instead, you create a new copy with the changes) - which is what we did here.
